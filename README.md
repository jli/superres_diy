# DIY super res

attempt to do ML-based image upscaling without relying to web-based versions
like <https://deep-image.ai/>

status:
- EDSR models are super slow; LapSRN also pretty slow (at least on CPU)
- currently not getting particularly good results
- maybe need to include more traditional image processing like noise reduction / sharpening?
